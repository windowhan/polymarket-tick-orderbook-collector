# Builder Program

> Build applications that route orders through Polymarket

A **builder** is a person, group, or organization that routes orders from users to Polymarket. If you've created a platform that allows users to trade on Polymarket through your system, this program is for you.

<Warning>
  EOA wallets do not have relayer access. Users trading directly from an EOA pay
  their own gas fees.
</Warning>

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="User Places Order">
    User places an order through your application.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Attach Builder Code">
    Your app adds your `builderCode` to the order struct.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Submit to CLOB">
    Order is submitted to Polymarket's CLOB — the builder code is serialized
    onchain as part of the signed order.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Trade Execution">
    Polymarket matches the order and covers gas fees for onchain operations.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Volume Attribution">
    Volume is credited to your builder account for every matched trade where
    your code is attached.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Getting Started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Builder Profile">
    Go to
    [polymarket.com/settings?tab=builder](https://polymarket.com/settings?tab=builder)
    and copy your builder code.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Attach Your Builder Code">
    Pass `builderCode` on every order you submit — see [Order
    Attribution](/trading/orders/attribution).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable Gasless Transactions">
    Use the Relayer Client for gas-free wallet deployment and onchain
    operations.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Track Performance">
    Monitor your volume on the [Builder
    Leaderboard](https://builders.polymarket.com).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Examples

These open-source demo applications show how to integrate Polymarket's CLOB Client and Builder Relayer Client for gasless trading with builder order attribution.

### Deposit Wallet Integrations

New API users should use deposit wallets. Use the Builder Relayer Client to
deploy deposit wallets and execute signed wallet batches, then place CLOB
orders with `POLY_1271`.

See the [Deposit Wallet Guide](/trading/deposit-wallets) for TypeScript,
Python, Rust, and direct API integration details.

### Existing Safe Wallet Examples

Existing Safe integrations can continue using Gnosis Safe wallets:
