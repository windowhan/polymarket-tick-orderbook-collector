# Builder Fees

> How builders earn fees on orders routed through their applications, and how to integrate.

CLOB V2 introduces a fee layer that lets builders earn a fee on every order routed through their application. When a builder attaches their unique **builder code** to an order and that order matches, a **builder fee** is collected alongside any platform fee.

Builder fees are flat percentages of trade notional, configured by each builder within enforced limits. They're additive — they stack on top of platform fees, never replace them.

## How it works

Builder fees and platform fees are independent. What the user pays depends on the market config and whether a builder code is attached:

| Market               | Builder code attached | User pays                  |
| -------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------- |
| No platform fee      | No                    | Nothing                    |
| No platform fee      | Yes                   | Builder fee only           |
| Platform fee enabled | No                    | Platform fee only          |
| Platform fee enabled | Yes                   | Platform fee + builder fee |

Builder fees never replace platform fees — they're always additive.

<Warning>
  Polymarket reserves the right to revoke your ability to charge a builder fee in its sole discretion, for any reason or no reason, including but not limited to instances where fees are determined to have been collected through fraudulent, deceptive, misleading, automated, self-referred, or other non-bona fide trading activity.
</Warning>

## Registration

Register for a builder code through your Polymarket account.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a builder profile">
    Go to [polymarket.com/settings?tab=builder](https://polymarket.com/settings?tab=builder) and set up your builder profile.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set your fee rates">
    Configure two rates on your profile:

    * `builder_taker_fee_bps` — charged on taker orders routed through your app
    * `builder_maker_fee_bps` — charged on maker orders routed through your app
  </Step>

  <Step title="Copy your builder code">
    Your profile is assigned a `bytes32` builder code. Attach it to every order you submit.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Fee rate limits

| Parameter      | Default    | Maximum       |
| -------------- | ---------- | ------------- |
| Taker fee rate | 0 bps (0%) | 100 bps (1%)  |
| Maker fee rate | 0 bps (0%) | 50 bps (0.5%) |
| Granularity    | —          | 1 bp (0.01%)  |

### Rate change policy

Fee rate changes are gated so users can see them coming:

* **Cooldown.** One rate change per 7 days.
* **Advance notice.** Changes take effect 3 days after being scheduled.
* **One pending change at a time.** You can't queue multiple changes — wait for the current one to take effect (or cancel it) before scheduling another.

***

## SDK integration

The V2 SDK handles builder codes natively — no separate signing library, no extra headers.

### Install

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash TypeScript theme={null}
  npm install @polymarket/clob-client-v2 viem
  ```

  ```bash Python theme={null}
  pip install py-clob-client-v2
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  Coming from the old `@polymarket/builder-signing-sdk` + HMAC header flow? That's gone in V2 — see [Migrating to CLOB V2](/v2-migration#builder-program) for the full upgrade path.
</Note>

### Attach your builder code

Pass `builderCode` on every order your application submits. This is how trades are attributed to your profile.

**Limit order:**

```typescript theme={null}
const response = await client.createAndPostOrder(
  {
    tokenID: "0x123...",
    price: 0.55,
    size: 100,
    side: Side.BUY,
    expiration: 1714000000,
    builderCode: process.env.POLY_BUILDER_CODE,
  },
  { tickSize: "0.01", negRisk: false },
  OrderType.GTC,
);
```

**Market order:**

```typescript theme={null}
const response = await client.createAndPostMarketOrder(
  {
    tokenID: "0x123...",
    side: Side.BUY,
    amount: 500,
    price: 0.5, // worst-price limit (slippage protection)
    userUSDCBalance: 1000, // optional — enables fee-aware fill calculations
    builderCode: process.env.POLY_BUILDER_CODE,
  },
  { tickSize: "0.01", negRisk: false },
  OrderType.FOK,
);
```

If `builderCode` is omitted, no builder fee is charged.

<Tip>
  You can also pass `builderConfig: { builderCode }` once at client construction and every order inherits it. See [Migrating to CLOB V2](/v2-migration#builder-program) for both patterns.
</Tip>

### Query fee parameters

`getClobMarketInfo()` returns both platform and builder fee parameters for a market:

```typescript theme={null}
const info = await client.getClobMarketInfo(conditionID);

// Platform fee
// info.fd.r   — fee rate
// info.fd.e   — fee exponent
// info.fd.to  — taker-only flag

// Builder fee
// info.mbf    — builder maker fee rate
// info.tbf    — builder taker fee rate
```

***

## Fee calculation

### Platform fees

Platform fees use a dynamic per-market formula:

```
platform_fee = C × feeRate × p × (1 - p)
```

Where `C` is the trade size, `p` is the order price, and `feeRate` is a per-market parameter. Platform fees are currently taker-only and are not configurable by builders.

### Builder fees

Builder fees are a flat percentage of notional:

```
builder_fee = notional × builder_fee_rate_bps / 10000
```

**Example.** A 1,000 pUSD taker buy routed through a builder charging 100 bps (1%) taker fee:

```
builder_fee = 1000 × 100 / 10000 = 10 pUSD
```

The maker and taker sides of a single trade can have different builder codes and different rates. If Builder A (0.3% maker) posts the resting order and Builder B (0.8% taker) submits the matching order, each earns their respective fee from their respective side.

### Balance checks

The CLOB's balance checker accounts for all applicable fees (platform + builder) when validating an order. Users must have enough pUSD to cover the trade plus the maximum possible fees.

For market buy orders, pass `userUSDCBalance` and the SDK computes fee-adjusted fill amounts automatically.

## Onchain attribution

Builder attribution is part of the signed V2 order struct — not an offchain label. The `builder` field appears in every `OrderFilled` event emitted by the CTF Exchange V2 contract.

### V2 order struct

```
salt, maker, signer, tokenId, makerAmount, takerAmount,
side, signatureType, timestamp, metadata, builder
```

The `builder` field is a `bytes32` matching your registered builder code.

### EIP-712 domain

The Exchange domain version is `"2"` in V2 (up from `"1"`). If you construct EIP-712 typed data manually rather than via the SDK, update your domain separator — see [For API users](/v2-migration#for-api-users) in the migration guide.

***

## Fee processing and payouts

When a user places an order with your `builderCode` attached:

1. The CLOB validates the order and the builder code.
2. At match time, the Fees Service computes the platform and builder fees for each side.
3. The trade settles onchain via `CTFExchangeV2.matchOrders()`, emitting `OrderFilled` events.
4. The Builders Service indexes those events, joins onchain attribution with your builder profile, and accrues your earned fees.

Collected builder fees are distributed to the wallet associated with your builder profile.

***

## Program policies

### Disabled codes

Polymarket may disable a builder code at any time — for violations of the Builder Program terms, abusive fee practices, or platform integrity concerns. Orders carrying a disabled code will be rejected by the CLOB.

### Public visibility

Builder profiles and fee rates are publicly queryable. This is intentional — it lets users and third parties see what a builder charges before using their app.

### Existing builders

Builders with V1 integrations have builder code entities provisioned automatically. No action is required beyond upgrading to the V2 SDK and attaching your builder code to orders. See [Migrating to CLOB V2](/v2-migration) for the full upgrade path.
