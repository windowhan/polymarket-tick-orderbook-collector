# Introduction

> Overview of the Polymarket APIs

The Polymarket API provides programmatic access to the world's largest prediction market. The platform is served by three separate APIs, each handling a different domain.

## APIs

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="Gamma API" icon="database">
    **`https://gamma-api.polymarket.com`**

    Markets, events, tags, series, comments, sports, search, and public profiles. This is the primary API for discovering and browsing market data.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Data API" icon="chart-line">
    **`https://data-api.polymarket.com`**

    User positions, trades, activity, holder data, open interest, leaderboards, and builder analytics.
  </Card>

  <Card title="CLOB API" icon="arrows-rotate">
    **`https://clob.polymarket.com`**

    Orderbook data, pricing, midpoints, spreads, and price history. Also handles order placement, cancellation, and other trading operations. Trading endpoints require [authentication](/api-reference/authentication).
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Info>
  A separate **Bridge API** (`https://bridge.polymarket.com`) handles deposits and withdrawals. Bridges are not handled by Polymarket, it is a proxy of fun.xyz service.

## Authentication

The Gamma API and Data API are fully public — no authentication required.

The CLOB API has both public endpoints (orderbook, prices) and authenticated endpoints (order management). See [Authentication](/api-reference/authentication) for details.
