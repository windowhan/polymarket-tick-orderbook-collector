# Geographic Restrictions

> Check geographic restrictions before placing orders on the Polymarket API

Polymarket restricts order placement from certain geographic locations due to regulatory requirements and compliance with international sanctions. Before placing orders, builders should verify the location.

<Warning>
  Orders submitted from blocked regions will be rejected. Implement geoblock
  checks in your application to provide users with appropriate feedback before
  they attempt to trade.
</Warning>

***

## Geoblock Endpoint

Check the geographic eligibility of the requesting IP address:

```bash theme={null}
GET https://polymarket.com/api/geoblock
```

<Note>This endpoint is on `polymarket.com`, not the API servers.</Note>

### Response

```json theme={null}
{
  "blocked": true,
  "ip": "203.0.113.42",
  "country": "US",
  "region": "NY"
}
```

| Field     | Type    | Description                                     |
| --------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `blocked` | boolean | Whether the user is blocked from placing orders |
| `ip`      | string  | Detected IP address                             |

## Blocked Countries

The following countries are restricted from placing orders on Polymarket. Countries marked as **close-only** can close existing positions but cannot open new ones. Countries marked as **frontend UI restricted** are blocked only on the Polymarket frontend; the API itself is not restricted:

## Blocked Regions

In addition to fully blocked countries, the following specific regions within otherwise accessible countries are also restricted:

| Country      | Region  | Region Code |
| ------------ | ------- | ----------- |
| Canada (CA)  | Ontario | ON          |
| Ukraine (UA) | Crimea  | 43          |
| Ukraine (UA) | Donetsk | 14          |
| Ukraine (UA) | Luhansk | 09          |

***

## Blocking Logic

The geoblocking system includes:

1. **OFAC-Sanctioned Countries**: Countries sanctioned by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)
2. **Additional Regulatory Restrictions**: Countries added for specific regulatory compliance reasons

***

## Server Infrastructure

* **Primary Servers**: eu-west-2
* **Closest Non-Georestricted Region**: eu-west-1

<Tip>
  **Direct co-location available.** Users who complete the [KYC/KYB
  form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfY-3Dl3yxq8HKFjFad8YzKZmm0k3Gdg29HD6gL-K-AmI6KXw/viewform) can get access to co-locate
  directly in `eu-west-2` for the lowest possible latency to Polymarket's
  primary servers.

## Why These Restrictions

Geographic restrictions are implemented to ensure compliance with:

* International sanctions and embargoes
* Local financial regulations
* Gambling and prediction market laws
* Anti-money laundering (AML) requirements
* Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations

If you believe you are incorrectly restricted or have questions about geographic availability, please contact [Polymarket Support](https://polymarket.com/support).
