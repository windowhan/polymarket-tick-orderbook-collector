# Check if a wallet is deployed

> Returns whether the wallet at the given address is deployed onchain.

Use the `type` query parameter to choose which wallet type to check:

- Pass user's Polymarket `SAFE` address (default): Gnosis Safe (SignatureType `2`).
- Pass user's Polymarket `WALLET` Deposit Wallet address: Deposit Wallet (signatureType `3`). See the [Deposit Wallet Guide](/trading/deposit-wallets) for setup.

Omitting `type` is equivalent to `type=SAFE`.

      Relayer API keys let a user authenticate requests to relayer endpoints
      without Gamma auth.

      However, Relayer API keys can only be created using Gamma auth. Every
      address can create a maximum of 100 keys.


      The API key auth headers are:

      - `RELAYER_API_KEY`

      - `RELAYER_API_KEY_ADDRESS`


      `RELAYER_API_KEY_ADDRESS` must match the address that owns the key.
