# Clients & SDKs

> Official open-source libraries for interacting with Polymarket

Polymarket provides official open-source clients in TypeScript, Python, and Rust. All three support the full CLOB API including market data, order management, and authentication.

## Installation

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash TypeScript theme={null}
  npm install @polymarket/clob-client-v2 viem
  ```

  ```bash Python theme={null}
  pip install py-clob-client-v2
  ```

  ```bash Rust theme={null}
  cargo add polymarket_client_sdk_v2 --features clob
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Quick Example

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript TypeScript theme={null}
  import { ClobClient } from "@polymarket/clob-client-v2";

  const client = new ClobClient({
    host: "https://clob.polymarket.com",
    chain: 137,
    signer,
    creds: apiCreds,
  });

  const markets = await client.getMarkets();
  ```

  ```python Python theme={null}
  from py_clob_client_v2 import ClobClient

  client = ClobClient(
      "https://clob.polymarket.com",
      key=private_key,
      chain_id=137,
      creds=api_creds,
  )

  markets = client.get_markets()
  ```

  ```rust Rust theme={null}
  use polymarket_client_sdk_v2::clob::{Client, Config};

  let client = Client::new("https://clob.polymarket.com", Config::default())?
      .authentication_builder(&signer)
      .authenticate()
      .await?;

  let markets = client.markets(None).await?;
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Each repository includes working examples in the `/examples` directory.

## Relayer SDK

For [gasless transactions](/trading/gasless), the relayer client handles deposit
wallet creation and signed wallet batches for new API users. Existing Safe and
Proxy wallet flows remain supported.
