# Get combo markets

> Returns active markets that can be used as combo legs, ordered by volume
descending. This endpoint is public and does not require CLOB
authentication.

Entries in `position_ids`, `outcomes`, and `outcome_prices` correspond by
array index (`[0]` is YES, `[1]` is NO). Use `next_cursor` unchanged in
the next request; a value of `null` indicates the final page.

  title: Polymarket Combinatorial RFQ API
  description: >
    REST API for the combinatorial RFQ (Request for Quote) system.


    This spec covers the publicly documented endpoints used by quoters (market

    makers): the combo-market catalog and the authenticated maker commands for

    submitting, cancelling, and confirming quotes.


    Conventions:

    - All `*_e6` fields are six-decimal fixed-point values encoded as
    **strings**
      to avoid number precision issues.
    - All timestamps are **Unix milliseconds** (integer); zero/omitted means
    unset.

    - Errors return an HTTP status code with a body of the form `{ "error":
    "..." }`.
