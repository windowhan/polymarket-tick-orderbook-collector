      Relayer API keys let a user authenticate requests to relayer endpoints
      without Gamma auth.

      However, Relayer API keys can only be created using Gamma auth. Every
      address can create a maximum of 100 keys.


      The API key auth headers are:

      - `RELAYER_API_KEY`

      - `RELAYER_API_KEY_ADDRESS`


      `RELAYER_API_KEY_ADDRESS` must match the address that owns the key.
