# Supported Assets

> Chains and tokens supported for deposits to Polymarket

The Bridge API supports deposits from multiple chains and tokens. All deposits are automatically converted to **pUSD on Polygon**, which is used as collateral for trading on Polymarket.

## Get Supported Assets

Retrieve the full list of supported chains and tokens with their minimum deposit amounts.

```bash theme={null}
curl https://bridge.polymarket.com/supported-assets
```

<Note>
  Supported assets change over time. Always call `/supported-assets` for the
  current list before initiating a deposit.
</Note>

## Minimum Amounts

Each asset has a `minCheckoutUsd` value—the minimum deposit amount in USD equivalent. Deposits below this threshold may fail to process.

Most L2 chains (Polygon, Arbitrum, Base, Optimism) have low minimums of $2, while Ethereum deposits require $7 minimum. Bitcoin and Tron have \$9 minimums due to higher bridging costs.
