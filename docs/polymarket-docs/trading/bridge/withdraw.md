# Withdraw

> Bridge pUSD from Polymarket to any supported chain

Withdraw pUSD from your Polymarket wallet to any supported chain and token. Funds are automatically bridged and swapped to your desired token on the destination chain.

## How It Works

1. Specify your destination chain, token, and recipient address
2. Receive bridge addresses for each destination chain (EVM, Solana, Bitcoin)
3. Send pUSD from your Polymarket wallet to the appropriate bridge address
4. Funds are automatically bridged and swapped to your desired token
5. Funds arrive at your destination wallet

<Warning>
  Do not pre-generate withdrawal addresses. Only generate them when you are
  ready to execute the withdrawal. Each address is configured for a specific
  destination.
</Warning>

<Warning>
  When withdrawing, pUSD is unwrapped to USDC via the Collateral Offramp and swapped through the
  [Uniswap v3 pool](https://polygonscan.com/address/0xd36ec33c8bed5a9f7b6630855f1533455b98a418)
  for USDC (native). The UI enforces less than 10bp difference in output amount.
  At times, this pool may be exhausted. If you are having withdraw issues, try
  breaking your withdraw into smaller amounts or waiting for the pool to be
  rebalanced. Alternatively, you can withdraw pUSD directly, which does not
  require Uniswap liquidity — just be aware that some exchanges no longer accept
  pUSD deposits directly.
</Warning>

<Tip>
  For very large withdrawals (over \$50,000), consider breaking the withdrawal
  into smaller amounts or using a third-party bridge to minimize slippage.
</Tip>

## Create Withdrawal Addresses

Generate bridge addresses configured for your withdrawal destination. See the [Bridge API Reference](/api-reference/introduction) for full request and response schemas.

```bash theme={null}
curl -X POST https://bridge.polymarket.com/withdraw \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "address": "0x9156dd10bea4c8d7e2d591b633d1694b1d764756",
    "toChainId": "1",
    "toTokenAddress": "0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48",
    "recipientAddr": "0xd8dA6BF26964aF9D7eEd9e03E53415D37aA96045"
  }'
```

### Address Types
