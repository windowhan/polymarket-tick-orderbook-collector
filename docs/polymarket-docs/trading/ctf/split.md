# Split Tokens

> Convert pUSD into outcome token pairs

**Splitting** converts pUSD collateral into a full (position) set of outcome tokens. For every \$1 pUSD you split, you receive 1 Yes token and 1 No token.

```
$100 pUSD → 100 Yes tokens + 100 No tokens
```

## Prerequisites

Before splitting, ensure you have:

1. **pUSD balance** on Polygon
2. **pUSD approval** for the CTF collateral adapter to spend your tokens
3. **Condition ID** of the market — the condition must already be prepared on the CTF contract (via `prepareCondition`)

<Note>
  Polymarket uses thin collateral adapter contracts for pUSD-native CTF actions.
  Approve the adapter once, then route split, merge, and redeem actions through
  it. The adapter handles the CTF collateral plumbing so user-facing flows stay
  in pUSD.
</Note>

<Note>
  If the partition is trivial, invalid, or refers to more slots than the
  condition is prepared with, the transaction will revert.
</Note>

## How It Works

1. You approve the CTF collateral adapter to spend your pUSD
2. You call the adapter's split flow with the amount and market details
3. The adapter calls the underlying CTF contract and mints both outcome tokens

The operation is atomic — if any step fails, the entire transaction reverts.
