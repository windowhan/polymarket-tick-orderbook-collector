# Redeem Tokens

> Exchange winning tokens for pUSD after market resolution

**Redeeming** converts winning outcome tokens into pUSD after a market resolves. Each winning token is worth exactly $1.00 — the losing token is worth $0.

```
Market resolves YES:
  100 Yes tokens → $100 pUSD
  100 No tokens  → $0
```

## When to Redeem

Redemption is only available **after a market resolves**. Once the oracle reports the outcome:

* **Winning tokens** can be redeemed for \$1.00 pUSD each
* **Losing tokens** are worth \$0 and produce no payout

<Note>
  You can redeem at any time after resolution — there's no deadline. Your
  winning tokens will always be redeemable.
</Note>

## How Resolution Works

1. The market's end condition is met (event occurs, date passes, etc.)
2. The UMA Adapter oracle reports the outcome via `reportPayouts()`
3. The CTF contract records the payout vector
4. Redemption becomes available for winning tokens

## Prerequisites

Before redeeming:

1. **Market must be resolved** — check the market's `resolved` status
2. **Hold winning tokens** — only the winning outcome can be redeemed
3. **Know the condition ID** — required for the redemption call

<Note>
  Polymarket uses thin collateral adapter contracts for pUSD-native CTF actions.
  Approve the adapter once, then route split, merge, and redeem actions through
  it. On redeem, the adapter burns the ERC1155 outcome tokens through the CTF
  contract, receives USDC.e collateral, wraps it into pUSD, and returns pUSD to
  your wallet automatically.
</Note>

## Function Parameters

<ResponseField name="collateralToken" type="IERC20">
  pUSD (Polymarket USD) contract address: `0xC011a7E12a19f7B1f670d46F03B03f3342E82DFB`
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="parentCollectionId" type="bytes32">
  Always `0x0000...0000` (32 zero bytes) for Polymarket markets
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="conditionId" type="bytes32">
  The market's condition ID
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="indexSets" type="uint[]">
  Array of index sets to redeem: `[1, 2]` redeems both outcomes (only winning
  pays)
</ResponseField>

<Note>
  Redemption burns your entire token balance for the condition — there is no
  amount parameter.
</Note>

## Payout Mechanics

The CTF uses a **payout vector** to determine redemption values:

| Outcome  | Payout Vector | Redemption        |
| -------- | ------------- | ----------------- |
| Yes wins | `[1, 0]`      | Yes = $1, No = $0 |
| No wins  | `[0, 1]`      | Yes = $0, No = $1 |

When you redeem through the adapter:

* Your token balance is multiplied by the payout
* Winning tokens are burned
* The released collateral is wrapped into pUSD and transferred to your wallet
* Losing tokens are burned as well, but produce a \$0 payout
