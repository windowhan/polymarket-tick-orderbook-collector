# Order Attribution

> Attribute orders to your builder code for volume credit and fee rewards

Order attribution credits trades to your builder account by attaching your **builder code** to every order. This enables:

* Volume tracking on the [Builder Leaderboard](https://builders.polymarket.com/)
* Fee rewards through the [Builder Program](/builders/overview)
* Performance monitoring via the Data API

***

## Builder Code

Your **builder code** is a `bytes32` identifier tied to your builder profile. Find it at [polymarket.com/settings?tab=builder](https://polymarket.com/settings?tab=builder).

That's the only credential you need for attribution — no HMAC signing, no separate API key, no special headers.

<Note>
  Builder codes are public identifiers — they appear onchain in the `builder`
  field of every order you attribute. Only you control which orders include your
  code, so keep it scoped to apps you own.
</Note>

***

## Attaching the Builder Code

Pass `builderCode` in the order struct on every order you submit. The SDK serializes it into the onchain order's `builder` field, and the protocol attributes every matched trade to your profile.

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript TypeScript theme={null}
  import { ClobClient, Side, OrderType } from "@polymarket/clob-client-v2";

  const client = new ClobClient({
    host: "https://clob.polymarket.com",
    chain: 137,
    signer,
    creds: apiCreds,
    signatureType: 3,
    funderAddress: depositWalletAddress,
  });

  const response = await client.createAndPostOrder(
    {
      tokenID: "0x...",
      price: 0.55,
      size: 100,
      side: Side.BUY,
      builderCode: "0xabc123...", // your builder code from polymarket.com/settings?tab=builder
    },
    { tickSize: "0.01", negRisk: false },
    OrderType.GTC,
  );
  ```

  ```python Python theme={null}
  from py_clob_client_v2 import ClobClient
  from py_clob_client_v2 import OrderArgs, OrderType, PartialCreateOrderOptions
  from py_clob_client_v2.order_builder.constants import BUY

  client = ClobClient(
      host="https://clob.polymarket.com",
      chain_id=137,
      key=private_key,
      creds=api_creds,
      signature_type=3,
      funder=deposit_wallet_address,
  )

  response = client.create_and_post_order(
      OrderArgs(
          token_id="0x...",
          price=0.55,
          size=100,
          side=BUY,
          builder_code="0xabc123...",  # your builder code from polymarket.com/settings?tab=builder
      ),
      options=PartialCreateOrderOptions(tick_size="0.01", neg_risk=False),
      order_type=OrderType.GTC,
  )
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Every order placed with `builderCode` attached is credited to your builder profile — no additional configuration needed.

## Verifying Attribution

Query trades attributed to your builder code:

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript TypeScript theme={null}
  const trades = await client.getBuilderTrades();

  // Filtered by market
  const marketTrades = await client.getBuilderTrades({
    market: "0xbd31dc8a...",
  });
  ```

  ```python Python theme={null}
  trades = client.get_builder_trades()

  market_trades = client.get_builder_trades(
      market="0xbd31dc8a..."
  )
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Each `BuilderTrade` includes: `id`, `market`, `assetId`, `side`, `size`, `price`, `status`, `outcome`, `owner`, `maker`, `builder`, `transactionHash`, `matchTime`, `fee`, and `feeUsdc`.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Volume not appearing on the leaderboard">
    <ul>
      <li>Confirm your `builderCode` is correctly attached to every order</li>
      <li>Check that orders are being matched, not just placed</li>
      <li>Allow up to 24 hours for volume to appear on the leaderboard</li>
    </ul>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Invalid builder code">
    Verify the code matches what's shown on [your Builder
    Profile](https://polymarket.com/settings?tab=builder). Builder codes are
    `bytes32` hex values starting with `0x`.
