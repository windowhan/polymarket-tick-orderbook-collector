# Maker Rebates Program

> Earn daily pUSD rebates by providing liquidity on Polymarket

Polymarket charges taker fees across multiple market categories. Fees are determined by the protocol at match time and fund a **Maker Rebates** program that pays daily pUSD rebates to liquidity providers.

***

## Why Maker Rebates

Deeper liquidity means tighter spreads, lower price impact, more reliable fills, and greater resilience during volatility. Maker Rebates incentivize **consistent, competitive quoting** so everyone gets a better trading experience.

***

## How Maker Rebates Work

* **Paid daily in pUSD:** Rebates are calculated and distributed every day.
* **Performance-based:** You earn based on the share of liquidity you provided that actually got taken.

### Eligibility

Place orders that add liquidity to the book and get filled (i.e., your liquidity is taken by another trader).

### Payment

Rebates are paid daily in pUSD, directly to your wallet. A minimum accrued rebate of **\$1 pUSD** is required for a payout.

***

## Funding

Maker Rebates are funded by taker fees collected in eligible markets. A percentage of these fees are redistributed to makers who keep the markets liquid. The rebate percentage differs by market type.

| Category        | Maker Rebate | Distribution Method |
| --------------- | ------------ | ------------------- |
| Crypto          | 20%          | Fee-curve weighted  |
| Sports          | 25%          | Fee-curve weighted  |
| Finance         | 25%          | Fee-curve weighted  |
| Politics        | 25%          | Fee-curve weighted  |
| Economics       | 25%          | Fee-curve weighted  |
| Culture         | 25%          | Fee-curve weighted  |
| Weather         | 25%          | Fee-curve weighted  |
| Other / General | 25%          | Fee-curve weighted  |
| Mentions        | 25%          | Fee-curve weighted  |
| Tech            | 25%          | Fee-curve weighted  |
| Geopolitics     | —            | Fee-free            |

<Note>
  Polymarket collects taker fees in eligible markets across all fee-enabled categories.
  The rebate percentage is at the sole discretion of Polymarket
  and may change over time.

## Fee-Curve Weighted Rebates

Rebates are distributed using the **same formula as taker fees**. This ensures makers are rewarded proportionally to the fee value their liquidity generates.

For each filled maker order:

```text theme={null}
fee_equivalent = C × feeRate × p × (1 - p)
```

Where **C** = number of shares traded and **p** = price of the shares. The fee parameters differ by market type:

| Category        | Taker Fee Rate | Maker Fee Rate |
| --------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| Crypto          | 0.07           | 0              |
| Sports          | 0.03           | 0              |
| Finance         | 0.04           | 0              |
| Politics        | 0.04           | 0              |
| Economics       | 0.05           | 0              |
| Culture         | 0.05           | 0              |
| Weather         | 0.05           | 0              |
| Other / General | 0.05           | 0              |
| Mentions        | 0.04           | 0              |
| Tech            | 0.04           | 0              |
| Geopolitics     | 0              | 0              |

Your daily rebate:

```text theme={null}
rebate = (your_fee_equivalent / total_fee_equivalent) * rebate_pool
```

Totals are calculated per market, so you only compete with other makers in the same market.

## Taker Fee Structure

Taker fees are calculated in pUSD and vary based on the share price. The fee amount in pUSD is symmetric around 50% probability — a trade at 30¢ incurs the same dollar fee as a trade at 70¢.

### Fee Tables (100 Shares)

For detailed fee tables for each market category, see the [Fees](/trading/fees) page.

### Fee Precision

Fees are rounded to 5 decimal places. The smallest fee charged is 0.00001 pUSD. Anything smaller rounds to zero, so very small trades near the extremes may incur no fee at all.
