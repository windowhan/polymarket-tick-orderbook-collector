# Combos

> Build a market maker integration for pricing and executing Combos

Combos are multi-leg positions that combine multiple underlying market outcomes
into one YES or NO position. Each Combo is defined by its legs and identified by
derived YES and NO position IDs.

The request for quote (RFQ) system enables quote-based Combo execution between
two participants: Polymarket users (requesters) and market makers (quoters). A
user creates a Request, which starts an auction among connected market makers.
Market makers compete by submitting Quotes: executable prices they are willing to
fill.

        deactivate Quoter
    end
    RFQ->>Execution: Execute accepted Combo
    Execution-->>Requester: Send execution update
    Execution-->>Quoter: Send execution update
```

1. **User creates an unsigned Request** for a Combo price.
2. **RFQ system sends the Request** to connected market makers.
3. **Market makers submit signed Quotes** within the 400 ms submission window.
4. **RFQ system returns the best Quote** to the user.
5. **User accepts the Quote** by signing the trade within the 10-second
   acceptance window.
6. **RFQ system requests Last Look confirmation** when Last Look is enabled.
7. **Market maker confirms or declines** within the 1-second confirmation window.
8. **RFQ system executes the accepted Combo**.
9. **User receives execution updates**.
10. **Market maker receives execution updates**.

<Note>
  Combo position IDs are complementary to CLOB token IDs. A user can trade the
  market on the CLOB or can include the market as a leg of a Combo.
</Note>

This guide shows market makers how to handle Combo RFQs. You will open a quoting
session, respond to incoming requests, cancel submitted quotes when needed,
confirm fills through Last Look, and monitor execution updates.

## Start Quoting

Start by preparing an authenticated quoting session with the RFQ system.

          ```bash yarn theme={null}
          yarn add @polymarket/client@beta viem
          ```
        </CodeGroup>

        <Note>
          This page uses Viem for wallet signing. See the [TypeScript tooling
          guide](/dev-tooling/typescript) for other wallet library integrations.
        </Note>
      </Step>

      <Step title="Create a Secure Client">
        Create an instance of `SecureClient` with a wallet that has funds for fulfilling
        user requests and its signer details.

        ```ts theme={null}
        import { createSecureClient, relayerApiKey } from "@polymarket/client";
        import { privateKey } from "@polymarket/client/viem";

        const client = await createSecureClient({
          wallet: process.env.POLYMARKET_WALLET_ADDRESS!,
          signer: privateKey(process.env.PRIVATE_KEY!),
          apiKey: relayerApiKey({

            address: process.env.RELAYER_API_KEY_ADDRESS!,
          }),
        });
        ```

        The Relayer API key is necessary for setting up trading approvals in the next
        step. Create a [Relayer API key](https://polymarket.com/settings?tab=api-keys)
        from Settings > API Keys.

      <Step title="Create a Secure Client">
        Create an `AsyncSecureClient` with a wallet that has funds for fulfilling user
        requests and its signer details.

        ```python theme={null}
        import os

        from polymarket import AsyncSecureClient, RelayerApiKey


        client = await AsyncSecureClient.create(
            private_key=os.environ["PRIVATE_KEY"],
            wallet=os.environ["POLYMARKET_WALLET_ADDRESS"],

                address=os.environ["RELAYER_API_KEY_ADDRESS"],
            ),
        )
        ```

        The Relayer API key is necessary for setting up trading approvals in the next
        step. Create a [Relayer API key](https://polymarket.com/settings?tab=api-keys)
        from Settings > API Keys.

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="API">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Open the WebSocket">
        Connect to the RFQ system WebSocket.

        ```text theme={null}
        wss://combos-rfq-gateway-quoter.polymarket.com/ws/rfq
        ```
      </Step>

      <Step title="Acquire CLOB Credentials">
        RFQ WebSocket authentication uses CLOB API credentials: API key, secret, and
        passphrase. If you need credentials, start with [Getting API
        Credentials](/api-reference/authentication#using-the-rest-api).
      </Step>

      <Step title="Resolve Quoter Identity">
        Resolve the order signer identity before sending `auth`. The RFQ system needs
        the address that signs the order, the wallet that funds the order, and the
        signature type that connects those two addresses.

        | Wallet Type    | `signature_type` | `signer_address`              | `maker_address`      |
        | -------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------- |
        | Deposit Wallet | `3` POLY\_1271   | Deposit wallet address        | Deposit wallet       |
        | Safe Wallet    | `2` Safe         | Authenticated signing address | Derived Safe wallet  |
        | Poly Proxy     | `1` Proxy        | Authenticated signing address | Derived proxy wallet |
        | EOA            | `0` EOA          | EOA address                   | Same EOA address     |

        For more detail, see [Signature Types and
        Funder](/api-reference/authentication#signature-types-and-funder).
      </Step>

      <Step title="Authenticate">
        Send `auth` as the first WebSocket message within 30 seconds. Include the CLOB
        credentials and the `signer_address`, `maker_address`, and `signature_type`
        values resolved in the previous step. This example uses a Deposit Wallet.

        ```json Deposit Wallet theme={null}
        {
          "type": "auth",
          "auth": {
            "apiKey": "YOUR_API_KEY",
            "secret": "YOUR_API_SECRET",
            "passphrase": "YOUR_API_PASSPHRASE"
          },
          "identity": {
            "signer_address": "<signer_address>",
            "maker_address": "<maker_address>",
            "signature_type": 3 // <signature_type>
          }
        }
        ```

        A successful authentication response looks like:

        ```json Deposit Wallet theme={null}
        {
          "type": "auth",
          "success": true,
          "address": "0xAuthenticatedAddress",
          "role": "maker"
        }
        ```
      </Step>

      <Step title="Keep the Connection Alive">
        The RFQ system uses WebSocket protocol heartbeat frames to keep the connection
        alive. It sends a ping frame every 30 seconds with payload `rfq`; your client
        must respond with a pong frame that echoes the same payload. Most WebSocket
        clients handle this automatically.

        These are protocol frames, not JSON messages in the RFQ event stream.

## Handle Quote Requests

Quote requests describe a user's intent to buy or sell shares in a Combo defined
by a given set of legs. A quote request can currently only buy or sell the YES
side of a Combo.

The following cases show how a market maker can satisfy a user's buy or sell
request using collateral or inventory.

| Quote Request | Using Collateral      | From Inventory         |
| ------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Buy YES       | Buy NO at `1 - price` | Sell YES at `price`    |
| Sell YES      | Buy YES at `price`    | Sell NO at `1 - price` |

See [Combinatorial Positions](/trading/ctf/combinatorial) for more detail on the
YES/NO position model.

Quoters should respond within the **400 ms** submission window.

### Authorize the Quote

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="TypeScript">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Switch on Event Type">
        First, switch on `event.type` to handle quote requests from the session stream.

        ```ts theme={null}
        switch (event.type) {
          case "quote_request":
            // event: RfqQuoteRequestEvent
            void handleQuoteRequest(event);
            break;

          // …
        }
        ```
      </Step>

      <Step title="Evaluate Request">
        Then, inspect the `RfqQuoteRequestEvent` before pricing it.

        | Field                | Type                   | Description                                |
        | -------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
        | `rfqId`              | `RfqId`                | RFQ identifier used to correlate responses |
        | `requestorPublicId`  | `RfqRequestorPublicId` | Public identifier for the user request     |
        | `conditionId`        | `ComboConditionId`     | Derived Combo condition ID                 |
        | `direction`          | `RfqDirection`         | Whether the user wants to buy or sell      |
        | `side`               | `RfqSide.Yes`          | Currently always `RfqSide.Yes`             |
        | `requestedSize`      | `RfqRequestedSize`     | User-requested notional or share size      |
        | `yesPositionId`      | `PositionId`           | Derived YES Combo position ID              |
        | `noPositionId`       | `PositionId`           | Derived NO Combo position ID               |
        | `legPositionIds`     | `PositionId[]`         | Underlying leg position IDs                |
        | `submissionDeadline` | `EpochMilliseconds`    | Unix-millisecond quote submission deadline |

        `requestedSize` is an `RfqRequestedSize` value that describes how the user sized
        the request.

        ```ts theme={null}
        type RfqRequestedSize =
          | {
              unit: RfqRequestedSizeUnit.Notional;
              value: DecimalString;
            }
          | {
              unit: RfqRequestedSizeUnit.Shares;
              value: DecimalString;
            };
        ```

        Where:

        * `notional`: the target value of the request in collateral currency. For
          example, `"3"` means the user wants roughly 3 pUSD worth of the Combo, with the
          resulting share size derived from the quote price.
        * `shares`: the target number of Combo outcome tokens. For example, `"10"` means
          the user wants 10 shares, or 10,000,000 base units.

        In both cases, `value` is a normalized decimal string.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Submission">
        Finally, handle pricing, quote submission, and persistence outside the session
        loop before the `event.submissionDeadline` deadline. Price the request as pUSD
        per YES Combo share; for example, `0.45` means `0.45` pUSD per share. If you do
        not want to quote the request, skip submission.

        ```ts theme={null}
        async function handleQuoteRequest(event: RfqQuoteRequestEvent) {
          const price = priceComboRequest(event);

          if (price === undefined) return;

          const reference = await event.quote({ price });

          storeQuoteReference(reference);
        }
        ```

    </Steps>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Python">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Check Event Type">
        First, use `isinstance(...)` to handle quote requests from the session stream.

        ```python theme={null}
        from polymarket import RfqQuoteRequestEvent


        async for event in session:
            if isinstance(event, RfqQuoteRequestEvent):

        | `direction`           | `RfqDirection`           | Whether the user wants to buy or sell      |
        | `side`                | `RfqSide`                | Currently always `RfqSide.YES`             |
        | `requested_size`      | `RfqRequestedSize`       | User-requested notional or share size      |
        | `yes_position_id`     | `PositionId`             | Derived YES Combo position ID              |
        | `no_position_id`      | `PositionId`             | Derived NO Combo position ID               |
        | `leg_position_ids`    | `tuple[PositionId, ...]` | Underlying leg position IDs                |
        | `submission_deadline` | `int`                    | Unix-millisecond quote submission deadline |

        `requested_size` is an `RfqRequestedSize` value that describes how the user sized
        the request.

        ```python theme={null}
        from dataclasses import dataclass
        from decimal import Decimal

        from polymarket import RfqRequestedSizeUnit


        @dataclass(frozen=True, slots=True, kw_only=True)
        class RfqRequestedSize:
            unit: RfqRequestedSizeUnit
            value: Decimal
        ```

        Where:

        * `RfqRequestedSizeUnit.NOTIONAL`: the target value of the request in collateral
          currency. For example, `Decimal("3")` means the user wants roughly 3 pUSD worth
          of the Combo, with the resulting share size derived from the quote price.
        * `RfqRequestedSizeUnit.SHARES`: the target number of Combo outcome tokens. For
          example, `Decimal("10")` means the user wants 10 shares, or 10,000,000 base
          units.

        In both cases, `value` is a `Decimal`.

      <Step title="Submission">
        Finally, handle pricing, quote submission, and persistence outside the session
        loop before the `event.submission_deadline` deadline. Price the request as pUSD

        A `notional` request specifies a target pUSD amount; the fillable share size is
        derived from the quote price. A `shares` request specifies the exact number of
        Combo outcome tokens requested.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Build the Order">
        Decide the `price` in base units for a full share. A full share is `1000000`
        share base units, and `1` pUSD is `1000000` pUSD base units. For example, a
        price of `0.45` pUSD per share means `price = 450000`.

        Determine `size` from the request:

        | `requested_size.unit` | `size`                                             |
        | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
        | `notional`            | `floor(requested_size.value_e6 * 1000000 / price)` |
        | `shares`              | `requested_size.value_e6`                          |

        Then determine the order token and amounts:

        | Quote Request | Token             | `makerAmount`                              | `takerAmount` |
        | ------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------- |
        | `SELL` YES    | `yes_position_id` | `ceil(price * size / 1000000)`             | `size`        |
        | `BUY` YES     | `no_position_id`  | `ceil((1000000 - price) * size / 1000000)` | `size`        |

        The examples below quote `1` share, so `size = 1000000`.

### Quote Partial Fills

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="TypeScript">
    If you only want to fill part of the requested size, pass `size` with the quote.
    `size` is a normalized decimal value: `"10"` means 10 shares, or 10,000,000 base
    units. When omitted, the SDK quotes the full requested size.

    ```ts theme={null}
    await event.quote({
      price: "0.45",
      size: "10",
    });
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Python">
    If you only want to fill part of the requested size, pass `size` with the quote.
    `size` is a `Decimal`-compatible value: `Decimal("10")` means 10 shares, or
    10,000,000 base units. When omitted, the SDK quotes the full requested size.

    ```python theme={null}
    from decimal import Decimal


    await event.quote(
        price=Decimal("0.45"),
        size=Decimal("10"),
    )
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="API">
    Partial fills use the same signed-order flow as a full quote.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Determine the Quote Size">
        Start by converting `requested_size` into the full request size in share base
        units.

        | `requested_size.unit` | Full request size                                  |
        | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
        | `notional`            | `floor(requested_size.value_e6 * 1000000 / price)` |
        | `shares`              | `requested_size.value_e6`                          |

        Choose a partial `size` in share base units that is smaller than the full request
        size.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Build the Partial Order">
        Compute the signed order amounts from the partial `size`.

        | Quote Request | Token             | `makerAmount`                              | `takerAmount` |
        | ------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------- |
        | `SELL` YES    | `yes_position_id` | `ceil(price * size / 1000000)`             | `size`        |
        | `BUY` YES     | `no_position_id`  | `ceil((1000000 - price) * size / 1000000)` | `size`        |

### Use Inventory

    By default, quotes use collateral (pUSD) to buy YES or NO tokens as needed to
    satisfy the quote request according to the combinatorial position logic. Pass
    `source: "inventory"` when you want to quote from existing inventory instead.

    ```ts theme={null}
    await event.quote({
      price: "0.45",
      source: "inventory",
    });
    ```

  <Tab title="Python">
    By default, quotes use collateral (pUSD) to buy YES or NO tokens as needed to
    satisfy the quote request according to the combinatorial position logic. Pass
    `source=RfqQuoteSource.INVENTORY` when you want to quote from existing inventory
    instead.

    ```python theme={null}
    from decimal import Decimal

    from polymarket import RfqQuoteSource


    await event.quote(
        price=Decimal("0.45"),
        source=RfqQuoteSource.INVENTORY,

    Inventory quotes sell existing outcome tokens instead of spending collateral. The
    RFQ quote price still means pUSD per YES Combo share.

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Choose the Inventory Token">
        Use the token you already hold for the side of the quote request.

        | Quote Request | Inventory Token   | Order Side |
        | ------------- | ----------------- | ---------- |
        | `BUY` YES     | `yes_position_id` | SELL       |
        | `SELL` YES    | `no_position_id`  | SELL       |
      </Step>

      <Step title="Build the Inventory Order">
        Compute the signed order amounts from the inventory `size`.

        | Quote Request | Order Price       | `makerAmount` | `takerAmount`                               |
        | ------------- | ----------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
        | `BUY` YES     | `price`           | `size`        | `floor(price * size / 1000000)`             |
        | `SELL` YES    | `1000000 - price` | `size`        | `floor((1000000 - price) * size / 1000000)` |

        This example quotes `1` share at `0.45` pUSD per share, so `price = 450000` and
        `size = 1000000`:

## Manage Combo Positions

Use Combo position workflows to manage inventory throughout the quote lifecycle.

### List Combo Positions

List Combo positions as part of your background inventory sync. Keep this state
fresh outside the quote path.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="TypeScript">
    Use `client.listComboPositions(...)` to page through Combo positions for the
    authenticated account. Filter by status, Combo condition ID, or Combo position
    ID when you only need a subset of positions.

    ```ts theme={null}
    import { ComboPositionStatus, type ComboPosition } from "@polymarket/client";

    const positions = client.listComboPositions({
      status: ComboPositionStatus.Open,
      pageSize: 50,
    });

    for await (const page of positions) {
      for (const position of page.items) {
        // position: ComboPosition
      }
    }
    ```

    Each returned item is a `ComboPosition`.

<Note>
  **Displaying closed (redeemed) positions.** `entry_cost_usdc` is the
  *remaining* cost basis (`entry_avg_price × shares_balance`), so it reads `~0`
  once a winning combo is redeemed — and `shares_balance` does too. Two fields
  carry the closed-position economics instead:

  * `realized_payout_usdc` — gross redemption proceeds (winning shares redeem
    1:1 at \$1; accumulates under `PARTIAL`)
  * `total_cost_usdc` — original cost basis, reconstructed as
    `entry_avg_price × (shares_balance + realized_payout)`

  Net result of a finished combo = `realized_payout_usdc − total_cost_usdc`.
</Note>

### Inventory Management

If you want to quote from inventory, build the inventory before quote requests
arrive. Splitting converts collateral into complementary Combo positions for a
set of legs. Merging converts matching complementary Combo positions back into
collateral.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="TypeScript">
    Use `client.splitPosition(...)` with `legs` to create Combo inventory from
    collateral. `amount` is in pUSD base units.

    ```ts theme={null}
    const split = await client.splitPosition({
      amount: 10_000_000n,
      legs: ["<leg_position_id_1>", "<leg_position_id_2>"],
    });

    const splitOutcome = await split.wait();

    // splitOutcome.transactionHash identifies the confirmed split transaction.
    ```

    Use `client.mergePositions(...)` with the same `legs` to merge complementary
    Combo positions back into collateral. Pass `amount: "max"` to merge the largest
    matching amount available.

    ```ts theme={null}
    const merge = await client.mergePositions({
      amount: "max",
      legs: ["<leg_position_id_1>", "<leg_position_id_2>"],

    Use the Relayer API to split or merge Combo inventory by sending an ordered list

        First, determine whether the inventory action needs an approval. If approval is
        already in place, skip this step.

        For a split, `<maker_address>` must approve pUSD spending by the Router. For a
        merge, `<maker_address>` must approve the Router as a PositionManager ERC-1155
        operator.

        <CodeGroup>
          ```solidity ERC-20 Approval theme={null}
          function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) returns (bool);
          ```

          ```solidity ERC-1155 Approval theme={null}
          function setApprovalForAll(address operator, bool approved);
          ```
        </CodeGroup>

        Encode one of these approval calls when needed. Keep the resulting call object;
        it will be added before the Combo calls in the next step.

        <CodeGroup>
          ```json Split Approval Call theme={null}
          [
            {
              "target": "0xC011a7E12a19f7B1f670d46F03B03f3342E82DFB",
              "value": "0",
              "data": "<approve_calldata>"
            }
          ]
          ```

          ```json Merge Approval Call theme={null}
          [
            {
              "target": "0x006F54F7f9A22e0000CC2AB60031000000ae9fEF",
              "value": "0",
              "data": "<set_approval_for_all_calldata>"
            }
          ]
          ```
        </CodeGroup>
      </Step>

      <Step title="Build the Call List">
        Then, add the Combo call objects to the ordered list.

        For a split, include `prepareCondition` before `split`. `prepareCondition` is
        idempotent, so it is safe to include even when the Combo condition was already
        prepared. For a merge, call `merge` directly with the Combo condition ID for the
        positions being merged.

        ```solidity theme={null}
        function prepareCondition(uint256[] legs) returns (bytes31);
        function split(bytes31 conditionId, uint256 amount);
        function merge(bytes31 conditionId, uint256 amount);
        ```

        Append these encoded calls after the approval call from the previous step, if one
        was needed.

        <CodeGroup>
          ```json Split Combo Calls theme={null}
          [
            // Include the approval call first when needed.
            // …

              "target": "0x30000034706c7d8e12009dab006be20000c031a8",
              "value": "0",
              "data": "<prepare_condition_calldata>"
            },
            {
              "target": "0x12121212006e4CD160D18e3f00711DA5c3372600",
              "value": "0",
              "data": "<split_calldata>"
            }
          ]
          ```

          ```json Merge Combo Calls theme={null}
          [
            // Include the approval call first when needed.
            // …

              "target": "0x12121212006e4CD160D18e3f00711DA5c3372600",

              "data": "<merge_calldata>"
            }
          ]
          ```
        </CodeGroup>
      </Step>

      <Step title="Fetch the Nonce">
        Fetch a fresh `WALLET` nonce before each submission.

### Redeem Resolved Positions

When a Combo position resolves, redeem the winning position to settle it back to
collateral.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="TypeScript">
    Use `client.redeemPositions(...)` with a Combo `positionId`. The SDK redeems the
    available balance for that resolved position.

    ```ts theme={null}
    const redeem = await client.redeemPositions({
      positionId: "<yes_position_id|no_position_id>",
    });

    const redeemOutcome = await redeem.wait();

    // redeemOutcome.transactionHash identifies the confirmed redemption transaction.
    ```

    You can list resolved winning positions first, then redeem each one.

    ```ts theme={null}
    import { ComboPositionStatus } from "@polymarket/client";

    for await (const page of client.listComboPositions({
      status: ComboPositionStatus.ResolvedWin,
    })) {
      for (const position of page.items) {
        const redeem = await client.redeemPositions({
          positionId: position.positionId,
        });

        await redeem.wait();
      }
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Python">
    Use `client.redeem_positions(...)` with a Combo `position_id`. The SDK redeems
    the available balance for that resolved position.

    ```python theme={null}
    redeem = await client.redeem_positions(
        position_id="<yes_position_id|no_position_id>",
    )

    redeem_outcome = await redeem.wait()

    # redeem_outcome.transaction_hash identifies the confirmed redemption transaction.
    ```

    You can list resolved winning positions first, then redeem each one.

    ```python theme={null}
    positions = client.list_combo_positions(status="RESOLVED_WIN")

    async for position in positions.iter_items():
        redeem = await client.redeem_positions(
            position_id=position.position_id,
        )

        await redeem.wait()
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="API">
    Use the Relayer API to redeem resolved Combo positions by sending an ordered list
    of encoded contract calls in one batch. The following steps assume you are using
    a Deposit Wallet.

    <Note>
      If you use a Safe or Poly Proxy wallet, use one of the SDKs instead because
      those wallet integrations require wallet-specific signing and encoding.
    </Note>

    | Contract        | Address                                      |
    | --------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
    | Router          | `0x12121212006e4CD160D18e3f00711DA5c3372600` |
    | PositionManager | `0x006F54F7f9A22e0000CC2AB60031000000ae9fEF` |

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Check Approval">
        First, determine whether `<maker_address>` has approved the Router as a
        PositionManager ERC-1155 operator. If approval is already in place, skip this
        step.

        ```solidity theme={null}
        function setApprovalForAll(address operator, bool approved);
        ```

        Encode the approval call when needed. The approval call becomes the first object
        in the final `calls` array.

        ```json theme={null}
        [
          {
            "target": "0x006F54F7f9A22e0000CC2AB60031000000ae9fEF",
            "value": "0",
            "data": "<set_approval_for_all_calldata>"
          }
        ]
        ```
      </Step>

      <Step title="Determine Redeem Inputs">
        Set the Router inputs for the redemption.

        | Value          | Source                                |
        | -------------- | ------------------------------------- |
        | `conditionId`  | `<combo_condition_id>`                |
        | `outcomeIndex` | `0` for YES, `1` for NO               |
        | `amount`       | Shares to redeem, in share base units |

        The Router accepts `conditionId`, `outcomeIndex`, and `amount`, not `positionId`.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Build the Call List">
        The Router redeem function is:

        ```solidity theme={null}
        function redeem(bytes31 conditionId, uint256 outcomeIndex, uint256 amount);
        ```

        Append the redeem call after the approval call from the previous step, if one was
        needed.

        ```json Redeem Calls theme={null}
        [
          // Include the approval call first when needed.
          // …

            "data": "<redeem_calldata>"
          }
        ]
        ```
      </Step>

      <Step title="Fetch the Nonce">
        Fetch a fresh `WALLET` nonce before each submission.

        ```bash theme={null}
        curl -G "https://relayer-v2.polymarket.com/v1/account/transactions/params" \
          -H "RELAYER_API_KEY: $RELAYER_API_KEY" \

          --data-urlencode "address=$RELAYER_API_KEY_ADDRESS" \
          --data-urlencode "type=WALLET"
        ```

        The response includes the nonce to sign with the transaction.

        ```json theme={null}
        {
          "address": "<RELAYER_API_KEY_ADDRESS>",
          "nonce": "<wallet_nonce>"
        }
        ```
      </Step>

      <Step title="Build the EIP-712 Batch">
        Build the Deposit Wallet EIP-712 `Batch` typed data.

        ```json theme={null}

        Sign the EIP-712 batch with your signer. Use the resulting signature as
        `signature` in the relayer submission.

      <Step title="Submit the Transaction">
        Submit the signed transaction to the Relayer API.

## Get Combo Markets

Use the Combo markets catalog to retrieve active markets that can be used as
Combo legs. Markets are ordered by volume descending.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="TypeScript">
    Use `client.listComboMarkets(...)` to page through markets that can be used as
    Combo legs.

    ```ts theme={null}
    const paginator = client.listComboMarkets({ pageSize: 50 });

    for await (const page of paginator) {
      // page.items: ComboMarket[]
    }
    ```

    Use `exclude` to omit markets you have already shown or selected.

    ```ts theme={null}
    const paginator = client.listComboMarkets({
      exclude: selectedConditionIds,
      pageSize: 50,
    });
    ```

    The SDK returns structured YES and NO outcomes.

    async for market in paginator.iter_items():
        print(market.title, market.outcomes.yes.position_id)
    ```

    Use `exclude` to omit markets you have already shown or selected.

    paginator = client.list_combo_markets(
        exclude=selected_condition_ids,
        page_size=50,

    The SDK returns structured YES and NO outcomes with snake\_case fields.

    ```python theme={null}

## Map Legs to Markets

Market makers should build their own view of the markets that support Combos
before quote requests arrive. Combo-enabled markets expose a list of position
IDs with two entries: the first is the YES position ID and the second is the NO
position ID. These IDs identify the outcome positions your pricing system can map
back to market data.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="TypeScript">
    Fetch non-closed markets and index them by position ID in your own market data
    store.

    ```ts theme={null}
    for await (const page of client.listMarkets({ closed: false })) {
      for (const market of page.items) {
        for (const positionId of market.positionIds) {
          marketByPositionId.set(positionId, market);
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    You can also fetch markets by leg position ID on demand, but most market makers
    will want this context ready before the **400 ms** quote window starts.

    ```ts theme={null}
    const page = await client
      .listMarkets({
        positionIds: event.legPositionIds,

## Listen to Execution Updates

Execution updates tell you what happened after one of your quotes was selected.
Use them to reconcile RFQ state, transaction hashes, and terminal execution
outcomes in your own systems.

## Cancel Quotes

After you submit a quote, keep the returned quote reference. If your price,
inventory, or risk changes before the quote is selected, use that reference to
request cancellation.

<Note>
  A cancellation acknowledgement means the RFQ system processed the cancellation
  request. It does not guarantee the quote was withdrawn from an RFQ that was
  already selected.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="TypeScript">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Store the Quote Reference">
        First, keep the quote reference returned by `event.quote(…)`. It contains the

    If Last Look is enabled for your maker, the RFQ WebSocket sends
    `RFQ_CONFIRMATION_REQUEST` after your quote is selected.

    ```json theme={null}
    {
      "type": "RFQ_CONFIRMATION_REQUEST",
      "rfq_id": "<rfq_id>",
      "quote_id": "<quote_id>",
      "signer_address": "<signer_address>",
      "maker_address": "<maker_address>",
      "signature_type": 3, // <signature_type>
      "leg_position_ids": ["<leg_position_id_1>", "<leg_position_id_2>"],
      "condition_id": "<combo_condition_id>",
      "yes_position_id": "<yes_position_id>",
      "no_position_id": "<no_position_id>",
      "direction": "BUY",
      "side": "YES",

      "price_e6": "450000",
      "confirm_by": 1780963200000
    }
    ```

    Respond before `confirm_by` with `CONFIRM` or `DECLINE`.

    <CodeGroup>
      ```json Confirm theme={null}
      {
        "type": "RFQ_CONFIRMATION_RESPONSE",
        "rfq_id": "<rfq_id>",
        "quote_id": "<quote_id>",
        "decision": "CONFIRM"

        "quote_id": "<quote_id>",
        "decision": "DECLINE"
      }
      ```
    </CodeGroup>

    The RFQ system acknowledges the response with
    `ACK_RFQ_CONFIRMATION_RESPONSE`.

    ```json theme={null}
    {
      "type": "ACK_RFQ_CONFIRMATION_RESPONSE",
      "rfq_id": "<rfq_id>",
      "quote_id": "<quote_id>",
      "decision": "CONFIRM"
    }
    ```

    Do not include `signer_address`, `maker_address`, or `signature_type` in
    `RFQ_CONFIRMATION_RESPONSE`. The RFQ system applies identity from the
    authenticated session.

## Handle Errors

In this section, we will talk you through how to handle errors with the RFQ system.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="TypeScript">
    ### Open the RFQ Session

    Wrap `client.openRfqSession()` in `try`/`catch` and use
    `OpenRfqSessionError.isError(…)` to narrow the error type.

    ```ts theme={null}
    try {
      const session = await client.openRfqSession();
    } catch (error) {
      if (!OpenRfqSessionError.isError(error)) throw error;

      switch (error.name) {
        case "TransportError":
          // error: TransportError
          break;
      }
    }
    ```

    ### Submit a Quote

    Wrap `event.quote(…)` in `try`/`catch` and use `RfqQuoteError.isError(…)` to
    narrow the error type.

    ```ts theme={null}
    try {
      const reference = await event.quote({ price });
      // …
    } catch (error) {
      if (!RfqQuoteError.isError(error)) throw error;

      switch (error.name) {
        case "RfqQuoteRejectedError":
          // error: RfqQuoteRejectedError
          // error.rfqId: RfqId
          // error.code: RfqErrorCode | undefined
          break;
        case "SigningError":
          // error: SigningError
          break;
        case "TimeoutError":
          // error: TimeoutError
          break;
        case "TransportError":
          // error: TransportError
          break;
        case "UserInputError":
          // error: UserInputError
          break;
      }
    }
    ```

    ### Cancel a Quote

    Wrap `session.cancelQuote(…)` in `try`/`catch` and use
    `RfqCancelQuoteError.isError(…)` to narrow the error type.

    ```ts theme={null}
    try {
      const ack = await session.cancelQuote(reference);
      // …
    } catch (error) {
      if (!RfqCancelQuoteError.isError(error)) throw error;

      switch (error.name) {
        case "RfqCancelQuoteRejectedError":
          // error: RfqCancelQuoteRejectedError
          // error.rfqId: RfqId
          // error.quoteId: RfqQuoteId
          // error.code: RfqErrorCode | undefined
          break;
        case "TimeoutError":
          // error: TimeoutError
          break;
        case "TransportError":
          // error: TransportError
          break;
      }
    }
    ```

    ### Confirm or Decline

    Wrap `event.confirm()` or `event.decline()` in `try`/`catch` and use
    `RfqConfirmationError.isError(…)` to narrow the error type.

    ```ts theme={null}
    try {
      if (canStillFill) {
        await event.confirm();
      } else {
        await event.decline();
      }
    } catch (error) {
      if (!RfqConfirmationError.isError(error)) throw error;

      switch (error.name) {
        case "RfqConfirmationRejectedError":
          // error: RfqConfirmationRejectedError
          // error.rfqId: RfqId
          // error.quoteId: RfqQuoteId
          // error.code: RfqErrorCode | undefined
          break;
        case "TimeoutError":
          // error: TimeoutError
          break;
        case "TransportError":
          // error: TransportError
          break;
      }
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Python">
    ### Open the RFQ Session

    Wrap `client.open_rfq_session()` in `try`/`except` and catch SDK exception types.

    ```python theme={null}
    from polymarket import TimeoutError, TransportError


    try:
        async with client.open_rfq_session() as session:
            async for event in session:
                ...
    except TimeoutError as error:
        # error: TimeoutError
        ...
    except TransportError as error:
        # error: TransportError
        ...
    ```

    ### Submit a Quote

    Wrap `event.quote(...)` in `try`/`except` and catch the typed RFQ rejection,
    timeout, and transport errors.

    ```python theme={null}
    from decimal import Decimal

    from polymarket import RfqQuoteRejectedError, TimeoutError, TransportError


    try:
        reference = await event.quote(price=Decimal("0.45"))
    except RfqQuoteRejectedError as error:
        # error.rfq_id: RfqId
        # error.code: RfqErrorCode | None
        ...
    except TimeoutError as error:
        # error: TimeoutError
        ...
    except TransportError as error:
        # error: TransportError
        ...
    ```

    ### Cancel a Quote

    Wrap `session.cancel_quote(...)` in `try`/`except` and catch the typed RFQ
    cancellation rejection, timeout, and transport errors.

    ```python theme={null}
    from polymarket import RfqCancelQuoteRejectedError, TimeoutError, TransportError


    try:
        ack = await session.cancel_quote(reference)
    except RfqCancelQuoteRejectedError as error:
        # error.rfq_id: RfqId
        # error.quote_id: RfqQuoteId
        # error.code: RfqErrorCode | None
        ...
    except TimeoutError as error:
        # error: TimeoutError
        ...
    except TransportError as error:
        # error: TransportError
        ...
    ```

    ### Confirm or Decline

    Wrap `event.confirm()` or `event.decline()` in `try`/`except` and catch the typed
    RFQ confirmation rejection, timeout, and transport errors.

    ```python theme={null}
    from polymarket import RfqConfirmationRejectedError, TimeoutError, TransportError


    try:
        if can_still_fill:
            await event.confirm()
        else:
            await event.decline()
    except RfqConfirmationRejectedError as error:
        # error.rfq_id: RfqId
        # error.quote_id: RfqQuoteId
        # error.code: RfqErrorCode | None
        ...
    except TimeoutError as error:
        # error: TimeoutError
        ...
    except TransportError as error:
        # error: TransportError
        ...

    When a WebSocket command fails validation or cannot be applied, the RFQ system
    sends `RFQ_ERROR`.

    ```json theme={null}
    {
      "type": "RFQ_ERROR",
      "request_type": "RFQ_QUOTE",
      "rfq_id": "<rfq_id>",
      "quote_id": "<quote_id>",
      "code": "SUBMISSION_WINDOW_CLOSED",
      "error": "submission window closed"
    }
    ```

    Use `request_type`, `rfq_id`, and `quote_id` to correlate the error with the
    command you sent.

    | `request_type`              | Failed command                    |
    | --------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
    | `RFQ_QUOTE`                 | Quote submission                  |
    | `RFQ_QUOTE_CANCEL`          | Quote cancellation                |
    | `RFQ_CONFIRMATION_RESPONSE` | Last Look confirmation or decline |

    Common error codes include:

    | Code                                       | Meaning                                                  |
    | ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `INVALID_MESSAGE`                          | Message JSON or message type is invalid                  |
    | `UNKNOWN_RFQ`                              | RFQ ID is not active or no longer exists                 |
    | `EXPIRED_RFQ`                              | RFQ has expired                                          |
    | `SUBMISSION_WINDOW_CLOSED`                 | Quote arrived after the submission window closed         |
    | `ALLOWANCE_VALIDATION_FAILED`              | Maker allowance is insufficient for the quoted order     |
    | `BALANCE_VALIDATION_FAILED`                | Maker balance is insufficient for the quoted order       |
    | `PRE_EXECUTION_BALANCE_RESERVATION_FAILED` | Balance reservation failed before execution              |
    | `INVALID_QUOTE`                            | Quote payload or signed order is invalid                 |
    | `INVALID_RFQ_STATE`                        | RFQ is not in a state that accepts the requested command |
    | `INVALID_CONFIRMATION`                     | Last Look confirmation payload is invalid                |
    | `SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE`                      | RFQ service dependency is temporarily unavailable        |

    Treat these errors as command-level failures. Keep the WebSocket session alive
    unless the connection itself closes or authentication fails.
