# Overview

> Market making on Polymarket

A Market Maker (MM) on Polymarket is a trader who provides liquidity to prediction markets by continuously posting bid and ask orders. By laying the spread, market makers enable other users to trade efficiently while earning the spread as compensation for the risk they take.

Market makers are essential to Polymarket's ecosystem — they provide liquidity across markets, tighten spreads for better user experience, enable price discovery through continuous quoting, and absorb trading flow from retail and institutional users.

<Note>
  **Not a Market Maker?** If you're building an application that routes orders
  for your users, see the [Builder Program](/builders/overview) instead.

## Risks

<Warning>
  Be careful with spread management — if your bid price is higher than your ask
  price (a "negative spread" or "crossed market"), you will lose money on every
  fill. Always validate your quote prices before submission.
